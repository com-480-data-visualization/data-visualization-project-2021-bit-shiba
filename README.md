# Pick up your most coveted Pokémon!
When it comes to Pokémon, you may have a broad outline of it from the games, the anime, the movies, and the trading cards, or are completely bewildered by the Pokémon mania that’s gripping the Internet right now. Regardless of which camp you are in, sit back, grab your beverage of choice, and relax—we are going to get a detailed look of Pokémons and choose your favorite pocket monsters. Our website will contain ideally five different visualizations. The first part is a bubble diagram, presented in the form of "Poke balls". Then, in the second part, we wanna use the chord diagram to get an overview of the mix-type Pokémons. The third part is a violin graph to show the species strength distribution. Finally, we wanna users to choose their favorite Pokémons to form a team and exhibit their strength and weakness.
