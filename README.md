### Pick up your most coveted Pokémon!
When it comes to Pokémon, you may have a broad outline of it from the games, the anime, the movies, and the trading cards, or are completely bewildered by the Pokémon mania that’s gripping the Internet right now. Regardless of which camp you are in, sit back, grab your beverage of choice, and relax—we are going to get a detailed look of Pokémon and help you choose your favorite pocket monsters.

We attempt to bring insightful visualizations from different aspects to help users know Pokémons in detail. In the beginning, if Pokémon Trainers want to have their own pocket monsters, they need Poké balls to help them capture, transport, and train Pokémon. We showcase different types of Pokémons in Poké balls. Then, we showcase the relationship between the Pokémon's primary type and their secondary type. Furthermore, we showcase the Pokémon's species strength according to different types. In the last part, we want users to choose a their own Pokémon team and know the team's strength and weakness to help Pokémon Trainers attend a competition successfully.

### Problem statement

The era of data refreshes the way people explore the unknown, from basic construction to aerospace engineering. Prof Oak from Pallet Town keeps searching and helping Pokémon Trainer to train their Pokémon. He invented Pokédex to show basic instructions and simple analysis of Pokémon, including Pokémon’s height, weight, characteristics, etc. But We, as Pokémon trainers, always dream to be Pokémon Masters since we were children. So just analyzing the data of a single Pokémon is far from satisfying my needs.

Now as the Pokémon data scientists in Pallet Town, we want to help our children and rookies to explore the Pokémon world easily. We would like to give them some advice on how to choose their Pokémon. We want an elegant way to show them Pokémon’s characteristics and capabilities by using interactive graphs and tables instead of numbers.

Therefore we think about multiple views we would like to cover.

Which Pokémon suits them best?

And which Pokémon are ahead of the game in the battle?

How to choose a good team from thousands of Pokémon?

To capture our own Pokémon, which one is easier to tame?

How to present their characters and stories in good ways?

What kind of Pokémon will restrain each other?

……

We have 1028 Pokémon and each of them has 48 different characters. There are a lot of mysteries about them waiting for us to discover.


### Final result
Our website contain four different visualizations. The first part is a bubble diagram, presented in the form of "Poke balls". Then, in the second part, we wanna use the chord diagram to get an overview of the mix-type Pokémon. The third part is a violin graph to show the species strength distribution. Finally, we wanna users to choose their favorite Pokémon to form a team and exhibit their strength and weakness.
